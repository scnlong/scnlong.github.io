### About me

I received my master degree in applied mathematics and informatics from MIEM, HSE, and bachelor degree in chemistry from Inner Mongolia University. Previously I also worked in China and Switzerland as a researcher.

I am skilled in classical molecular dynamics simulation, and also worked on projects regarding to quantum physics, including mathematical physics, first principle density functional theory, quantum chemistry, numerical solutions of Schrödinger equation, etc.

I am fascinated with the potential connections between computation theory and enriched complex physical phenomena. Can a natural phenomenon be computed by many-body simultaneous and continuous computational units, instead of discrete states, symbols in alphabet and transitions between them in Turing machine?

### Research

 - ##### The mathematical structure of chemical space.
  I am considering incorporating nuclear charges and coordinates into the same framework in quantum mechanics. In this case, Hilbert space and Schrödinger equation need to be extended, [arXiv:2012.00843].

 - ##### Connections between computation theory and enriched complex physical phenomena.
Classical computation, in Turing machine sense, belongs to some kind of reductionism which reduce a complicated computation into discrete sets and mappings. Quantum computation, in contrast to classical one, it can be reduced to a robust continuous mixing of discrete states (i.e. superposition states) and discrete transitions. As for many physical experiments, which computations can simulate, to some extent, are *single* purpose many-body simultaneous and continuous *emergence* computations. If we unify computation and experiment within the same framework, with the view of continuity and complexity, what will be the theory connecting them?
